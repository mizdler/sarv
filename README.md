# Humidity Sensor Showcase for Sarv Project
You don't actually need the device. There's a Node.js server that can provide mockup data for the page.
Just run dummy.js server 
```bash
node dummy.js
```
...and open demo.html in your browser.

It's still in early stages and I've only focused on the script rather than the layout and overall presenations.

Timelapse images are extarcted from this licensed video and is available at 1080p resoulution, which can greately improve the presentation.
